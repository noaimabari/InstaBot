# InstaBot

This project is an instagram bot which completely automates the process of using Instagram.
Starting from logging in to searching of profiles, following/unfollowing profiles, liking/unliking of posts, watching stories, etc,
this bot can perform all the tasks which one generally needs to perform manually on instagram.
This bot is especially useful for buisiness or commercial pages, which have to follow large number of profiles, and perform most of the 
tasks on a large scale as it completely reduces the time and energy required to do such tasks manually.

I have used selenium framework for automating most of the tasks. For scarping of data wherever required, I have used BeautifulSoup.
Data Analysis has been done using various python libraries, and visualization of data is done with the help of matplotlib.pyplot.
